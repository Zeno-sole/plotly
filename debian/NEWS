plotly (4.1.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Plotly has been updated to its new major release 4.1.0.

  Prior versions of plotly.py contained functionality for creating
  figures in both “online” and “offline” modes. In “online” mode,
  figures were uploaded to the Chart Studio cloud (or on-premise)
  service, whereas in “offline” mode figures were rendered locally.

  Since version 4 the package provides offline only mode. All 
  functionality for interacting with Chart Studio has been moved from
  top-level `plotly` to a new top-level `chart-studio` module. (eg. 
  `chart_studio.plotly.plot`). This chart_studio module is no longer
  included in the plotly distribution package. Now it is included
  in a new optional chart-studio distribution package (See #934987)
